# Theovim

![theovim-demo.gif](./static/theovim-demo.gif)

Theovim is my personal Neovim configuration. Due to the requests from my classmates in CS252: Systems Programming who wanted IDE features while working on the infamous "shell project," I decided to take the Neovim configuration out of my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/theopn/dotfiles). I also like the name Theovim it's cute.

## Prerequisite

- `git` to update Theovim
- `bash` or a POSIX compliance shell
- Latest version of Neovim (> 0.8)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theopn/theovim.git ~/.theovim
~/.theovim/install.sh
```
